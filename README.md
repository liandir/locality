# Locality

Locality is a VS Code extension that turns a locally hosted
`llama.cpp` server into a coding assistant inside your editor. Its built-in
model requests are restricted to the configured localhost or private-network
endpoint.

**Choose the capabilities you want.** File tools stay within the workspace, and
model requests stay on the configured local/LAN endpoint. Four editions share
the same chat UI, storage, and Git commit-message generator:

| Edition | Model commands | Dedicated web search |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No commands | No execution implementation included | No |
| Safe list | User-configured regex rules and workspace checks for built-ins | No |
| Commands | General execution with your OS permissions | No |
| Advanced | General execution with your OS permissions | SearXNG |

Commands require approval by default. In Safe list, **Auto-approve safe commands**
applies equally to all matching commands, including deletion. Commands outside
the list always fail. Review mode always asks before commands; Plan mode has no
command tools. General commands and custom safe-list programs can access the
network and files according to their OS permissions. These profiles are not OS
sandboxes. File reads remain auto-approved by default; file edits are opt-in.

## Install

1. Open this repository on GitHub and go to **Releases**.
2. Download the latest `.vsix` asset (`locality-<edition>.vsix`).
3. Install it using either method:

   **From the terminal** (substitute your chosen edition):

   ```bash
   code --install-extension locality-safe-list.vsix
   ```

   **From inside VS Code:** open the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P`) and
   run **Extensions: Install from VSIX…**, then pick the file you downloaded.

4. Reload VS Code when prompted.

Direct downloads from the latest release:

| Edition | Download |
| --- | --- |
| No commands | [locality-no-commands.vsix](https://github.com/liandir/locality/releases/latest/download/locality-no-commands.vsix) |
| Safe list | [locality-safe-list.vsix](https://github.com/liandir/locality/releases/latest/download/locality-safe-list.vsix) |
| Commands | [locality-commands.vsix](https://github.com/liandir/locality/releases/latest/download/locality-commands.vsix) |
| Advanced | [locality-advanced.vsix](https://github.com/liandir/locality/releases/latest/download/locality-advanced.vsix) |

These URLs follow the release marked **Latest** on GitHub. Release assets keep
stable filenames across versions; the release tag and VSIX metadata identify the
version. Locally built packages retain the version in their filenames.

Editions use the same extension ID. Installing another edition replaces the
current one and preserves chats and shared settings. The installed edition is
shown in Settings. Commit-message generation is identical in all editions and
requires VS Code's built-in Git extension; there is no direct Git subprocess
fallback.

**Upgrading from Local LLM Harness:** Locality uses the new extension ID
`local.locality` and the `locality.*` settings/command namespace. Disable or
uninstall the old `local.local-llm-harness` extension after installing Locality.
On first activation, settings available in the installed edition are copied from
`localLlmHarness.*` into unset `locality.*` settings at the same scope. Existing
Locality values take precedence, and the old settings are kept. Each key is
migrated once, so resetting Locality does not restore old overrides. Custom
keybindings should use the new command IDs. Chat files stay in
`.local-llm-chats/`, so existing conversations and attachments remain available.

The **Locality** icon will appear in the Activity Bar on the left. The
welcome screen and the chat window both open initially; you can drag the chat
window to a location that is more comfortable for you.

## First-time setup

Click the Locality icon in the Activity Bar, then switch to the **Settings**
tab in the side panel. Configure the server and tool calling before chatting:

- **Server URL** — the address of your `llama.cpp` server, e.g.
  `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1` or `http://192.168.1.50:8080/v1`. It must be
  `localhost` or a private IP literal; DNS hostnames such as `nas.local` are
  refused. Click **Set** to validate the endpoint, list `/v1/models`, and read
  `/props` metadata. Choose the model below the URL; its reported alias and
  context length are shown alongside it.
- **Tool calling** — choose **Native server only** when the server reliably
  returns OpenAI-compatible structured calls. The Gemma 4, Qwen 3, Muse
  Glimmer, and GPT-OSS compatibility profiles still prefer structured calls,
  but can recover that family's exact syntax when it leaks into text. Gemma,
  Qwen, and GPT-OSS can also fall back to their legacy adapters when the server
  rejects native tools.
  Start `llama-server` with `--jinja` and a tool-aware chat template.

The other settings (sampling, auto-approve toggles, safe
commands) have sensible defaults and can be revisited later.


**Safe-list configuration:** choose **Edit User Settings** in the Settings tab.
`locality.safeCommandPatterns` is an array of regex strings matched against
the entire normalized command. Executable and arguments are separated by single
spaces; arguments needing quoting use shell-style single quotes. Patterns have no
flags. An empty array denies all commands; invalid patterns fail closed. The
list is included in the model's prompt. Workspace overrides are ignored.

Defaults include workspace searches, directory creation, and selected read-only
Git forms. `rm` and `rmdir` require a matching user-added pattern; neither is
included by default. Existing saved lists retain their configured entries.
Built-in path checks still protect the workspace boundary, root, and Git
metadata. Shell operators, redirection, expansion, and compound commands are unsupported. Safe list runs
executables outside the workspace from absolute PATH entries; on Windows, only
native executables are supported. The named Unix commands must be installed.
Safe Git currently requires a `.git` directory inside the workspace; linked
worktrees and parent-repository discovery are not supported. Narrow recursive
searches if the checked tree exceeds 10,000 entries.

**Advanced search:** enter a SearXNG **Web search endpoint** (base URL) and optional
**API-key** in Settings, above **Auto-approve web requests**. Click **Set** to
run a test JSON search for `SearXNG` and save the connection if successful.
This section sits between Chat (including workspace memories) and Automation.
Both `web_search` and `read_webpage` are omitted from tool definitions and system
prompts until the current endpoint is verified. Verification survives reloads;
a changed endpoint must be verified with Set. After upgrading, verify existing
connections once. The host stores verification separately from editable settings.
A blank or unverified endpoint disables both web tools; there is no public default. Connection,
authentication, rate-limit, and response-format errors appear in red.

A blank key sends no authentication header. When supplied, the key uses
`Authorization: Bearer …` (supported by PrivAU). Keys are kept in VS Code secret
storage, bound to the saved endpoint, and are never included in prompts, chat
history, or settings JSON. Clearing the key and pressing Set removes it after
a successful connection test. Changing the endpoint in user JSON does not send
an existing key to the new destination; use Set to configure its credentials.
This integration expects the SearXNG JSON API, not arbitrary search-provider APIs.

Each search and page read requires approval unless you enable **Auto-approve web requests**.
This switch applies in Act, Plan, and Review modes and is off by default.
`locality.webSearchEndpoint` and the approval switch are user settings;
workspace overrides are ignored. These features are available only in Advanced.

The search service must support JSON responses. Public endpoints require HTTPS;
HTTP is allowed for localhost/private IP addresses. Public instances may reject
or rate-limit API requests. Queries go to the configured service and its upstream
search engines. Search results provide URLs and snippets. `read_webpage` reads
public HTTP/HTTPS pages directly, returning a title, source URL, and readable
text. It strips scripts and navigation, follows up to five validated redirects,
and never sends the search key to websites. Responses are capped at 2 MiB and
20 seconds. Text excerpts default to 20,000 characters; `start`, `max_chars`
(up to 50,000), and `next_start` support reading more. It supports HTML and plain
text, without executing JavaScript, logging in, or parsing PDFs. Private/local
and reserved addresses are blocked, including redirects and DNS changes.

**Auto-approve web requests** covers both tools. The existing
`locality.autoapproveWebSearch` key is retained for settings compatibility.
Brave Search requires a separate provider adapter (its authentication header and
response schema differ); a Brave URL/key cannot be used directly here yet.

**Build and package:** `npm run build` develops the Commands edition. Use
`node esbuild.config.mjs --profile=no-commands` (or `safe-list`, `commands`,
`advanced`) to select another edition. `npm run package:vsix` builds and audits all
four packages into `artifacts/`. `npm run package:vsix -- --profile=safe-list`
packages one edition. The build rejects cross-edition imports and verifies the
contents of the actual VSIX archives. Only the selected feature implementations,
settings, prompts, and UI modules ship in each package.

### Muse Glimmer server requirements

Muse Glimmer requires llama.cpp build `b10353` or newer and `--jinja`. Its
template emits `to=self` reasoning, `to=user` answers, and ATEM tool calls;
current llama.cpp converts those into `reasoning_content`, `content`, and
structured `tool_calls` before the harness receives them. Do not add `<|eom|>`
as a stop string: it ends one message within a turn, while `<|eot|>` ends the
turn. The model's trained context is 131,072 tokens, and llama.cpp divides `-c`
across `-np` slots, so size `-c` accordingly. Muse always opens a reasoning
channel; the harness can cap it, but the template does not fully disable it.

For Muse image input, also load the matching perception projector:

```bash
llama-server \
  -m Muse-Glimmer-30B-KQuant-17GB-Q4_K_M.gguf \
  --mmproj mmproj-Muse-Glimmer-30B-Q4_K_M.gguf \
  --jinja -c 131072
```

The text GGUF is text-only without `--mmproj`. The projector must match the
loaded model build.

## Starting a chat

Open the harness panel and either:

- Click **+ New chat** on the Welcome page, or
- Click any past chat in the list to reopen it.

Type your question in the composer at the bottom of the chat panel and press
**Enter** to send. Use **Shift+Enter** for a newline. While the assistant is
responding, the send button turns into a stop button — click it (or the
cancel icon) to interrupt the current turn.

Chats open in tabs at the top of the chat panel. Switching tabs or reopening the
current chat preserves its running response, tool approvals, queued messages,
and attachments. Multiple chats can run at once; the local server determines
how their requests are scheduled. A blue dot marks running chats in the tabs
and Recent Chats.

Right-click a tab or a Recent Chats entry and choose **Rename** to change its
title. The **×** closes a tab without stopping its chat: reopen it from Recent
Chats to see its progress or use Stop. Closing VS Code or changing workspaces
stops running chats.

The brain button selects reasoning behavior per chat. **None** sends
`chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking: false`; **Default** sends no
`reasoning_effort` or thinking override. Additional choices come from the
`reasoningEfforts` setting and send its configured value as llama.cpp
`reasoning_effort`. This is independent of the numeric reasoning budget.

For example, the default `settings.json` mapping is:

```json
"locality.reasoningEfforts": {
  "Low": "low",
  "Medium": "medium",
  "High": "high"
}
```

### File attachments

Click **Attach files** (the paperclip) to choose images or text/code files.
You can attach up to eight files, mix images with code, send files with or
without a message, remove them before sending, and queue them while another
turn is running. Click an image thumbnail to enlarge it or a text-file icon
to open the stored copy in the editor.

**Ctrl+V** attaches files supplied by the clipboard, including explicit local
file URI lists. File names and suffixes are preserved; a clipboard MIME label
is not trusted to identify code (for example, a `.ts` file is TypeScript text).
Ordinary short text pastes into the composer. Text of at least **10,000
characters or 200 lines** becomes a **Pasted text** attachment with no filename
suffix or claimed programming language. Copying a path as plain text does not
read the file automatically; copy the file itself or use the picker.

Text/code files support UTF-8 and UTF-16 with a byte-order mark, up to **1 MiB**
each. Binary documents such as PDF, Word, and ZIP are not supported. The harness
synthesizes a model-only prompt containing your message plus each file's name,
optional suffix, and exact decoded contents. This works in native and legacy
tool modes. The visible chat retains your original message and attachment cards.
Text contents count toward context limits and normal compaction; the original
stored files are preserved when model context is shortened.

JPEG, PNG, and WebP images support up to **10 MiB** each. Images are copied into
chat-owned local storage and replayed as native OpenAI-compatible `image_url`
parts, with their names and file types included as text metadata. The loaded
model must support vision and `llama-server` must use its matching `--mmproj`.
Each retained image conservatively reserves 4,096 context tokens. If a
compatibility chat switches to a legacy tool adapter, image messages require
restarting the server with `--jinja` and native tool support, then retrying in a
new chat. Text-only attachments do not require a vision model.

The assistant streams its response as it goes. If the model supports a
"thinking" mode, you'll see a collapsible **Thinking…** row above the
response — click it to read the reasoning. When the thought is done, the
label becomes **Thought for N seconds**.

Workspace files mentioned by the assistant can appear as clickable file links.
Click one to open it in the editor, or hover it to see the full workspace path.

## Chat modes

The mode menu in the chat composer offers three ways to work:

- **Act mode** is the normal coding mode. The assistant can inspect the workspace,
  propose commands, and request approval for file changes.
- **Plan mode** restricts the assistant to read-only tools. It can browse and read
  files but cannot write or run commands, and it finishes with an implementation
  plan.
- **Review mode** is read-only but answer-oriented. It can inspect files and
  answer questions about the workspace without producing an implementation plan.
  It may propose commands when they help validate a review, but every command
  requires explicit approval even when command auto-approval is enabled.

Once a Plan-mode response is rendered, you'll see two buttons:

- **Accept plan and execute** — turns plan mode off and asks the assistant
  to carry out what it just proposed.
- **Reject plan and suggest changes** — keeps plan mode on and lets you
  type feedback so the assistant can revise.

Use plan mode for anything non-trivial. It gives you a chance to redirect
before files are touched.

## Commit message generation

Open VS Code's **Source Control** view after staging changes. The Locality
button in the Source Control title bar can generate a commit message
from the staged diff.

- If staged changes exist, hover text reads **Generate commit message with
  Locality**. Click the button to send the staged diff to your configured
  local `llama.cpp` endpoint and write the generated message into Git's commit
  input box.
- If nothing is staged, hover text reads **Please stage changes before
  generating a commit message.** Clicking the button briefly wiggles the icon.
- While the model is working, the icon gently jumps like an active tool. The extension only drafts the
  message; it does not commit anything.

By default, the prompt asks for an imperative, concise subject line and a short
body only when it adds useful context. You can replace those instructions under
**Settings → User settings → Edit User Settings**—for example, to require
Conventional Commits, scopes, issue identifiers, or a particular body format.
The staged diff is always appended automatically.

## How tool calls work

When the assistant wants to interact with your workspace, it emits a tool
call which appears as a small card in the chat. Cards are color-coded:

- **Read tools** (`read_file`, `list_dir`, `glob`) — gray. Auto-approved by
  default; flip off **Auto-approve reads** in settings if you'd rather
  confirm each one.
- **File edit tools** (`create_file`, revision-checked atomic `edit_file`, and
  line-addressed `insert_text` / `replace_range` in native mode; line-addressed
  tools in legacy mode) — gray, with
  a unified diff preview when expanded. Requires your approval by default.
  Click **Accept changes** to apply, or **Reject changes and suggest
  changes** to refuse and leave feedback in the composer.
- **Commands** (in command-capable editions; `run_process` in native mode, `run_command` in legacy mode) —
  purple. Each approved command runs as an isolated background child process;
  no VS Code terminal is opened, and bounded stdout/stderr appear in the
  expanded tool card. Native commands use a program and argument vector without
  a shell. The assistant can decide when a command would help and propose it
  directly. Every command requires manual approval by default. Turning on
  **Auto-approve commands** (or **Auto-approve safe commands**) skips the prompt
  in Act mode for commands permitted by that edition.
  Review mode always requires explicit approval.
  **Checking process** cards show the original command and offer the same Stop
  control as **Running command** while the process is running. The command also
  remains visible in saved **Checked process** cards.
- **Errors** — if a tool fails (e.g. file not found, write permission
  denied), the card turns red and the error is fed back to the assistant so
  it can self-correct without ending the chat. Click any card to expand it
  and inspect arguments, raw output, or the diff.

## Project instructions (`AGENTS.md`)

If a file named `AGENTS.md` exists at the root of your workspace, its contents
are loaded into the assistant's system prompt as standing instructions for that
project — a place to record build/test commands, code-style conventions, or any
context the model should keep in mind on every turn.

- **Root only.** Only the workspace-root `AGENTS.md` is read; nested
  `AGENTS.md` files in sub-directories are not (yet) supported.
- **Always on, no setup.** It is picked up automatically whenever the file is
  present — there is no setting to enable. Remove the file to turn it off.
- **Live.** The file is re-read each turn, so edits take effect on your next
  message without reloading. An empty file is ignored, and very large files are
  truncated to keep the context window usable.
- **Authority.** Project instructions rank *below* the harness's own safety
  rules and your live chat messages: if they conflict, the harness rules and
  your request win. Treat `AGENTS.md` as guidance, not a way to lift the
  network isolation or tool restrictions.

This follows the same [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md) convention used by other
coding agents, so a file you already maintain for them works here too.

## Command approval

In Commands and Advanced, **Auto-approve commands** controls approval for all
command tool calls (`run_process` and `run_command`) in Act mode. It is off by
default, so each command waits for you to approve or reject it. Turning it on
lets commands run without an approval prompt. Review mode always requires
explicit command approval, and Plan mode cannot run commands.

Safe list uses **Auto-approve safe commands** with the same approval behavior
for every matching command. Nonmatching commands always fail. No commands
contains neither setting nor executor.

General commands run with the permissions and environment of the VS Code extension
host. They may access the network, start other programs, or reach files outside
the workspace; the file tools' workspace restrictions do not sandbox commands.

## Managing context

A small ring on the composer toggle bar shows how full the model's context
window is. When it gets close to full:

- **Auto-compact** (on by default) summarizes older parts of the
  conversation when context reaches the configured threshold (80% by
  default).
- If auto-compact is off, the context ring turns red at that threshold so
  you can compact manually before the next request gets too large.
- You can also click the context ring at any time to compact immediately.

Compaction summarizes older details in the model's context so it has room to
keep working. The saved chat and visible history retain the original messages
and file attachments. The model receives the summary and recent context;
if an older detail matters, quote it in a new message. Editing an earlier
message rebuilds context from the retained transcript. Messages already removed
by compaction in older versions cannot be recovered automatically.

## Settings reference

| Setting | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `endpoint` | `http://localhost:8080/v1` | URL of your llama.cpp server. Use `localhost` or a private IP literal such as `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1` or `http://192.168.1.50:8080/v1`. |
| `model` | `local` | Model id sent with requests. The Settings view replaces this fallback with a selection from llama.cpp's `/v1/models` response. |
| `toolCallingMode` | `compat-gemma4` | Select `native`, `compat-gemma4`, `compat-qwen3`, `compat-muse-glimmer`, or `compat-gpt-oss`. Compatibility profiles are native-first and add only the selected family's recovery behavior. |
| `temperature` | `0.8` | Sampling temperature for chat requests. Lower is more deterministic, higher more varied. |
| `topK` | `40` | Top-k sampling: keep only the K most likely tokens at each step (`0` disables). |
| `topP` | `0.95` | Top-p (nucleus) sampling: keep the smallest token set whose cumulative probability reaches p (`1` disables). |
| `reasoningBudget` | `-1` | Per-request reasoning budget: `-1` is unlimited, `0` ends reasoning immediately, and a positive number is the token threshold. |
| `reasoningEfforts` | `{ "Low": "low", "Medium": "medium", "High": "high" }` | Additional chat-menu choices. Keys are display labels and values are sent as `reasoning_effort`; built-in None and Default remain available. |
| `titlePrompt` | `Summarize the user message…` | Instructions for generating chat titles. The first user message is appended automatically. |
| `commitMessagePrompt` | `Write a concise Git commit message…` | Instructions for generated commit messages. The staged diff is appended automatically, so this can enforce formats such as Conventional Commits. |
| `autoCompact` | `true` | Summarize old turns automatically near the context limit. |
| `autoCompactThresholdPercent` | `80` | Context usage percentage that triggers auto-compaction. |
| `autoapproveReads` | `true` | Skip approval for read-only file tools. |
| `autoapproveWrites` | `false` | Skip approval for file-edit tool calls. Off by default. |
| `autoapproveCommands` | `false` | Commands and Advanced: skip command approval in Act mode. Review always asks. |
| `autoapproveSafeCommands` | `false` | Safe list: skip approval for every matching command in Act mode. Review always asks. |
| `safeCommandPatterns` | Built-in regex list | Safe list: whole-command patterns in user settings; empty means deny all. |
| `webSearchEndpoint` | `""` | Advanced: SearXNG base URL, configured and tested in Settings. Empty or unverified omits both web tools. |
| `autoapproveWebSearch` | `false` | Advanced: auto-approve searches and page reads in Act, Plan, and Review modes. User settings only. |

The generated-text settings are instruction strings, not templates, so they do
not need variables. The harness constructs the requests as follows:

```text
<titlePrompt>

User message: "<first user message>"
```

```text
<commitMessagePrompt>

<staged_diff>
<staged Git diff>
</staged_diff>
```

The **Reset** section at the bottom of the Settings tab has a **Restore all
defaults** button that returns every setting above — including the server URL —
to its default. It asks for confirmation first.

The sampling settings (`temperature`, `topK`, `topP`) are sent with every chat
request, so they override whatever `--temp`, `--top-k`, or `--top-p` flags the
`llama.cpp` server was started with. Commit-message generation also uses the
configured temperature. Titles, memories, and context compaction keep their own
fixed low-temperature settings.

## Where chats are stored

Chats are saved in your home folder under `.local-llm-chats/`, not inside the
workspace. Each chat record stores the workspace folder it belongs to, and the
Recent Chats list only shows records whose folder matches the currently open
workspace. This keeps chat transcripts out of recursive workspace commands such
as `grep`. Image attachments are stored beside the chat records in a restricted
attachment directory and are removed when their chat or source message is
deleted, including when editing an earlier message discards later turns.
Compaction alone does not delete saved attachments.

You can delete a chat by hovering its row in the Welcome list and clicking the
trash icon. Deleting cannot be undone.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` | Send message |
| `Shift+Enter` | Newline in composer |

## Privacy & isolation

- The model endpoint validator refuses DNS hostnames other than exact `localhost`;
  use loopback, link-local, CGNAT, or RFC 1918 private IP literals.
- File tools cannot read or write outside the workspace root.
- Commit-message generation reads only staged changes (`git diff --cached`)
  and sends that diff to the configured local/LAN endpoint.
- Only Advanced includes search and webpage reading, with approval per request by default.
  **Auto-approve web requests** skips those prompts when enabled. General commands run with your normal
  permissions and can fetch URLs, call APIs, install packages, or access files
  outside the workspace. Command approval is required by default; enabling
  **Auto-approve commands** permits these actions without a prompt in Act mode.

---

## Development

The sections below are only relevant if you are building, testing, or modifying
the extension from source. Installing a released `.vsix` (see **Install** above)
does not require any of this.

### Build a `.vsix` from source

If you'd rather build the extension yourself than download a release, package a
`.vsix` from this repository and install it.

1. Make sure dependencies are installed (see **Development setup** below):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build and package the `.vsix`:

   ```bash
   npm run package:vsix
   ```

   This builds four isolated editions, audits their bundles and archives, and
   writes `artifacts/locality-<version>-<edition>.vsix`. The version
   matches `package.json`.

3. Install the freshly built file the same way as a released one:

   ```bash
   code --install-extension artifacts/locality-<version>-safe-list.vsix
   ```

   Or, from inside VS Code, run **Extensions: Install from VSIX…** from the
   Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P`) and pick the file. Reload VS Code when
   prompted.

To rebuild after changing the source, re-run `npm run package:vsix` and install
the new file again (add `--force` to `code --install-extension` to overwrite the
previous install of the same version).

### Release downloads

The release workflow runs when a `v*` tag is pushed. After packaging and auditing
all four editions, it copies the versioned files from `artifacts/` into
`.build/release-assets/` using the stable filenames listed under **Install**.
Only those copies are uploaded to the GitHub release; local build filenames and
the version inside each VSIX stay unchanged. All four copies must be prepared
successfully before the upload step runs.

Website download buttons can use the `/releases/latest/download/` links above
without being updated for every release. The links become available once a
release containing the stable filenames is published and marked **Latest**.

### Development setup

You only need Node.js if you are building, testing, packaging, or modifying
the extension from source. Installing a released `.vsix` in VS Code does not
require Node.js.

Use Node.js `20.19.0` or newer. Node `22.x` is recommended. The current
development toolchain includes Vite, Vitest, Rolldown, and Shiki packages that
declare Node `20+` requirements; running `npm install` with Node `18` may print
`EBADENGINE` warnings, and tests can fail before they start with missing
runtime APIs such as `node:util.styleText`.

If your system Node is too old, install a project-local Node with `nvm`:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.4/install.sh | bash

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

nvm install 22
nvm use 22
node -v
```

Then install dependencies and run the checks:

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

If `nvm` is still not found after installation, close and reopen the terminal,
or source `~/.nvm/nvm.sh` as shown above.

## Workspace memory

Enable **Settings → Workspace memory → Use workspace memories** to let the
agent search and recall active summaries from other chats in the same workspace. It is off by
default and is stored in workspace settings (`locality.memoryEnabled`);
user-level activation is ignored. This switch controls whether memory tools are available. Generation and editing remain available when it is off.

After a response finishes, the harness queues a short memory summary using the
configured local model. New generated memories are active automatically; existing
individual exclusions are preserved. The workspace switch still controls whether
the agent can search and recall them.

A **Creating memory** card appears after the answer and becomes **Created memory**
when finished. If the chat already has a memory, the card shows **Updating memory**
and then **Updated memory**. Expand it to see the same full contents and date shown by recall.
Completed cards remain available when reopening the chat. A new message sent
during generation appears immediately beneath the active memory card;
the model request proceeds once that summary finishes. Compaction and commit-message
inference can interrupt generation; interrupted work resumes when idle.
In **Recent Chats** (the Chats tab), **Re-generate all memories** sits below
**Start new chat** and processes existing chats on request.
Use **Cancel generation** to clear queued work and cancel the current summary.

Select the **cloud icon** beside a chat’s delete button to inspect, edit, include/exclude, and
regenerate its summary. Saving an edit makes the summary manually maintained, so background
updates cannot overwrite it. **Regenerate** replaces it with an automatically
maintained summary. Failed generation can be retried without affecting the chat.
Summaries are limited to 384 tokens. Raw tool messages, hidden reasoning, and
imported memories are excluded from summarization input; common credential
formats are redacted, and the model is instructed to omit secrets.

Memories are retrieved only when the agent calls a tool; no summaries are
inserted automatically into the system prompt. When enabled, the system prompt
suggests considering memory retrieval at the beginning of a request:

- **`search_memories`** takes a `query` and returns matching `name`, `id`, and
  `date` fields, plus the total match count and whether results were truncated.
  Local BM25 keyword ranking includes title and phrase boosts, recognizes paths
  and camelCase/snake_case symbols, and breaks ties by date and source ID.
  It uses no embeddings, network requests, or retrieval model. Search covers all
  active, usable memories in the current workspace, excluding the current chat.
- **`recall_memory`** takes the exact `name` and `id` from search and returns
  those fields, the full UTC `date`, and `contents`. IDs are 16 hexadecimal
  characters from SHA-256 of the source chat ID, name, and contents. Identical
  names are disambiguated; renaming or editing a memory changes its ID. Recall
  checks the current source again, so stale IDs and inactive or deleted sources
  fail with a request to search again.

Both tools return full UTC dates with minute precision, such as
`2026-09-11T14:05Z`. **Maximum search results** sets the per-search limit from
1 to 100, defaulting to 10 (`locality.memoryMaxCount`). The agent chooses
which matches to recall. The tools work in Act, Plan, and Review modes and follow
the read-approval setting. When workspace memories are off, both tools and their
system-prompt guidance are omitted, and attempted calls cannot retrieve content.

**Recalled memories** shows the sources read through the tool, with links to
their editors in Recent Chats. Recalled contents are ordinary tool results in
chat history and are subject to normal context limits and compaction. Turning
memories off prevents new retrieval; it does not erase existing tool results.
Legacy automatic selections are no longer injected. Summary generation excludes
raw tool results and asks the model to omit facts merely copied from memories.
Current instructions and inspected code take precedence over historical memory.

Chat-card timestamps adapt to when you view them: time only today, day and short
month on other days in the same year, and the year for dates in another year.
They use local time without seconds; hover retains the full local date and time.
The latest saved user-message timestamp remains in system context only to place
the request relative to memory dates. Assistant timestamps are display-only.

For a reproducible, synthetic memory-on/off probe against a running local server:

```bash
npm run eval:memory -- http://localhost:8080 your-model-id /tmp/memory-eval.json
```

This records summary size, retrieval selections, recall/override checks, server
prompt/completion tokens, and elapsed response time. It is a small functional
probe, not a coding benchmark or a statistically reliable speed comparison.
